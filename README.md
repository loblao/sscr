# sscr
SchoolScript

TODO
A personal project of mine. In a nutshell, it's a custom script format which converts to HTML pages, useful for taking notes in classes (see samples, coming soon).

This code is a huge mess, I'll clean it up later.
This project has a lot of dependencies (to be fixed), so expect trouble trying to run it!

Some of the dependencies:

- Python 2.7
- SymPy
- Panda3D (soon)
- MathJax
- Django
